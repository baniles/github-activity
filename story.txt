Once upon a time there was a boy and his dog. The two loved going on walks together, and today was no different. It was a bright and sunny day, with temperatures in the mid 70s. While the boy and his dog were talking their walk today, they came across a small shiny object. The boy was obviously curious and approached it. As soon as he reached out to grab it, the wind picked it up and it started flying away!
The boy chased the shiny object as it blew away in the wind.  Just as the object began to fly away, the boy's dog jumped out ahead and grabbed it.  Upon inspection, the boy realized the shiny object was a diamond ring.
