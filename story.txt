Once upon a time there was a boy and his dog. The two loved going on walks together, and today was no different. It was a bright and sunny day, with temperatures in the mid 70s. While the boy and his dog were talking their walk today, they came across a small shiny object. The boy was obviously curious and approached it. As soon as he reached out to grab it, the wind picked it up and it started flying away!
